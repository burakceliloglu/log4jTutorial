# Log4JPractise
A simple project to practise the Log4J library.

The project consists of a simple GUI-based system for generating logs, simulating an external trigger. The logger signals the appender, and the appender(s) send the output to STDOUT or a log file. 
The main purpose of the project is to practise the Log4J library with a time-triggered logging mechansim. However, the configuration file also contains the code for generating different appenders for different logging levels in case the format needs to change with the levels. This is due to a misunderstanding on my part, but at least I have learned a bit about using multiple appenders. :D
